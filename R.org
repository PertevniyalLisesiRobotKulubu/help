The goal here is to get R set up thoughtfully and quickly. The profile
and environ set it up correctly. Always remember this and run R using those
configuration files.

- Steps
  - Review and Run =.Rsetup.sh= prepare the OS for R and R for your configuration
  - Review =.Renviron= to verify it is what you expect
  - Review =.Rprofile= to recall how you set it up
  - Review and Source =Rinstall= to install required packages
    - Verify the lib path is in the home directory =.libPaths()=
    - When R starts, it won't find any of the required packages. It will
      complain a lot. That is OK. Just keep running the install script until
      it is happy: =source("~/.Rinstall.r")=. Then restart R and everything should
      be fine.
    - Run the installation script 3-5 times, each time
      - Check the version that is running
      - Go back and read the transcript and make sure that it looks right
        - Build warnings
        - Configuration errors
        - Mask warnings
        - Package notifications
          - For example
            #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
data.table 1.9.6  For help type ?data.table or https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki
The fastest way to learn (by data.table authors): https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-analysis-the-data-table-way
            #+END_EXAMPLE
          - …
            #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Attaching package: ‘magrittr’

The following objects are masked from ‘package:testthat’:

    equals, is_less_than, not

            #+END_EXAMPLE
          - …
            #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
data.table + dplyr code now lives in dtplyr.
Please library(dtplyr)!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            #+END_EXAMPLE
      - Eventually that script will fail, for example
        - there is no package called ‘devtools’
          - Called =install.packages("devtools")= manually
          - Install order error
      - After running it a couple of times, it is finished

- When you install packages, R needs to know which repository it should use. If
  you don't tell it, then it will ask you every time. It is just doing its job.
  Make it easier for yourself and specify a repo for once and for all.
  - Via [fn:41269bb7: http://www.r-bloggers.com/installing-r-packages/]
  - Built-in docs explain that =local= should be used here
  - This could also be a one-liner: ~options("repos" = c(CRAN = "http://cran.r-project.org/"))~

- By default, hitting enter in the =browser= will submit a =c= for "continue
  execution at the next statement"
  - It is too easy to hit enter when you didn't mean it
  - It just /feels/ imprecise
  - Never let this happen, disable that feature

Do not allow automatic coercion of strings into factors, as you can specify this
by argument to make it /real/ obvious. Looks like the best way is to leave it
alone globally and always do it by hand though. hwickam commented that it is
bad, bad idea to make this option global not because of your code, but because
of everyone else's that you are using which relies on the option being set to
=TRUE=.

Be highly conservative about errors and warnings: handle the former immediately
and cause the latter to be errors. However, only do this after your workspace
has initialized correctly. Do so too soon and most things won't work because
this approach is only to handle /my/ issues. Imagine of the whole work just
handled their own issues! Anway, the safe values are set here, leave them alone.
Making them more aggressive will break your startup. When you are ready to set
things to be more aggressive, turn it on yourself

Partial matching is a neat and flexible feature for objects. In theory, it is
quite powerful and convenient. In practice it seems like a really bad idea to
me. It is a /personal preference/. It only makes sense from that perspective.
This could bork 3rd party code.

Locale:
- Make sure that the language is set correctly. I couldn't find anything specific
  about setting it this way other than various posts. In practice you would really
  put all of this in your system environment configuration, but I'm wanting to be
  a little more particular here because it affects operations on data structures,
  in particular sorting.
- Error messages are mostly useful when they are displayed in English, so make
  sure that the locale is always English [fn:24499ef7:    http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-patched/R-admin.html#Localization-of-messages].
  "Note that the LANGUAGE environment variable has precedence over ~LC_MESSAGES~ in
  selecting the language for message translation on most R platforms." [fn:51fe4215: http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/locales.html]
- Note:
  - My previous approach was to define a top level binding for the locale string
    and pass that reference to bind each of the following settings. That was fine
    until I wanted to be able to easily clear out all of the top-level bindngs to
    "reset" it with a =rm(ls())= kind of thing. For that reason, I just use the
    manifest strings here.

How you extract data from a dataframe is flexible and everyone can and may do it
differently. One option available is to use =SQL= [fn:2e49b888: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sqldf/index.html], so make it available.

Comments taken from [fn:c116c9a5: http://randyzwitch.com/sqldf-package-r/]
- "This [using SQL] is a skill that every analyst should possess"
- "Being able to write SQL will save you time and provide you with a way of
  getting repeatable results so that you don't have to focus on doing the
  calculations all the time and worrying about errors in Excel"
- "[instead] You can focus on the task of actually analyzing your data"

      - SQLite creates an in-memory database!
  - Details
    - The typical action of sqldf is to
    - create a database :: in memory
    - read in the data frames and files :: used in the select statement. This is
      done by scanning the select statement to see which words in the select
      statement are of class "data.frame" or "file" in the parent frame, or the
      specified environment if envir is used, and for each object found by
      reading it into the database if it is a data frame. Note that this
      heuristic usually reads in the wanted data frames and files but on
      occasion may harmlessly reads in extra ones too.
    - run the select statement :: getting the result as a data frame
    - assign the classes :: of the returned data frame’s columns if
      method = "auto". This is done by checking all the column names in the
      read-in data frames and if any are the same as a column output from the
      data base then that column is coerced to the class of the column whose
      name matched. If the class of the column is "factor" or "ordered" or if
      the column is not matched then the column is returned as is. If
      method = "auto.factor" then processing is similar except that "factor"
      and "ordered" classes and their levels will be assigned as well. The
      "auto.factor" heuristic is less reliable than the "auto" heuristic. If
      method = "raw" then the classes are returned as is from the database.
    - cleanup :: If the database was created by sqldf then it is deleted;
      otherwise, all tables that were created are dropped in order to leave the
      database in the same state that it was before. The database connection is
      terminated.
    - Warning :: Although sqldf is usually used with on-the-fly databases which
      it automatically sets up and destroys if you wish to use it with existing
      databases be sure to back up your database prior to using it since
      incorrect operation could destroy the entire database.
  - Value
    - The result of the specified select statement is output as a data frame.
    - If a vector of sql statements is given as x then the result of the last
      one is returned.
    - If the x and connection arguments are missing then it returns a new
      connection and also places this connection in the option sqldf.connection.
      - Great to know that the connection is cached!
  - Notes
    - Big FYI: Commas in columns will be parsed as column separators!
      - Recommends using =read.table= if this matter
  - Examples
    - They all demonstrate how to do it in R and then again with SQL
    - Super helpful
    - You seem to be able to do everything that you would expect possible
  - Thoughts
    - Need to grok both R and SQL to use this safely
    - Using temp tables is kind of huge
    - Via [fn:55ef7537: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19019883/how-to-handle-column-names-not-supported-by-sqldf-in-r]
      - Use =_= instead lf =.= in column names from a R call
        - Where is this in the documentation?

Notes from the official site [fn:078aba0c: https://code.google.com/p/sqldf/]
- Opening
  - How it works
    - The user simply specifies an SQL statement
    - in R using data frame names in place of table names
    - and a database with appropriate table layouts/schema is automatically
      created,
    - the data frames are automatically loaded into the database,
    - the specified SQL statement is performed,
    - the result is read back into R
    - and the database is deleted all automatically behind the scenes making the
      database's existence transparent to the user who only specifies the SQL
      statement.
  - Supports
    - SQLite
    - H2
    - PostgreSQL
    - MySQL
  - The FAQ mostly talks about SQLite
- Overview
  - with sqldf the user is freed from having to do the following, all of which
    are automatically done:
    - database setup
    - writing the create table statement which defines each table
    - importing and exporting to and from the database
    - coercing of the returned columns to the appropriate class in common cases
  - It an be used for
    - learning R if you know SQL
    - Doing it faster than R
    - Load portions of a really large file
- Troubleshooting
  - Set the driver expicitly
  - "error messages regarding a data frame that has a dot in its name. The dot
    is an SQL operator. Either quote the name appropriately or change the name
    of the data frame to one without a dot."
- FAQ
  - Column class conversion touched upon
  - Dots in names
    - Dots are SQL operators so can't use them
      - See =?SQL92Keywords=
    - For columns
      - Either use underscore
      - Or simply remove them
    - For tables
      - Double quote the name
  - H2 supports date types, which seems quite helpful
  - Name a column ending with two underscores and a type and the library will
    convert the type to R correctly
    - Mentioned in the docs
  - SQL is case *insensitive*
    - Don't rely on casing to differentiate column names
  - We may examine the in-memory database table structure
  - Be quite careful about CSV data that contains commas again as this lib
    won't handle it
  - Good examples of cleaning data gettig int into a R friendly format
  - Be sure to specify numeric values as integers or doubles so you get expected
    results from division
- Examples
  - Example 1. Ordering and Limiting
  - Example 2. Averaging and Grouping
  - Example 3. Nested Select
  - Example 4. Join
  - Example 5. Insert Variables
    - Hugely convenient
  - Example 6. File Input
  - Example 7. Nested Select
  - Example 8. Specifying File Format
  - Example 9. Working with Databases
  - Example 10. Persistent Connections
  - Example 11. Between and Alternatives
  - Example 12. Combine two files in permanent database
  - Example 13. read.csv.sql and read.csv2.sql
    - Uses SQLite's import facility to create an in-memory database
    - Then it reads the results of the query into R
    - The import does not involve R so it can handle larger files than R can
      assuming that the query results in a size that does fit
  - Example 14. Use of spatialite library functions
  - Example 15. Use of RSQLite.extfuns library functions
  - Example 16. Moving Average

That is a bit too terse. Intro to the README follows

#+begin_quote
The aim of devtools is to make your life as a package developer easier by providing R functions that simplify many common tasks. R packages are actually really simple, and with the right tools it should be easier to use the package structure than not. Package development in R can feel intimidating, but devtools does every thing it can to make it as welcoming as possible. devtools comes with a small guarantee: if because of a bug in devtools a member of R-core gets angry with you, I will send you a handwritten apology note. Just forward me the email and your address, and I'll get a card in the mail.

[[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/index.html][Lubridate]] makes it easier to work with dates and times by providing functions to identify and parse date-time data, extract and modify components of a date-time (years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds), perform accurate math on date-times, handle time zones and Daylight Savings Time. Lubridate has a consistent, memorable syntax, that makes working with dates fun instead of frustrating.

[[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plyr/index.html][plyr]] is a set of tools that solves a common set of problems: you need to break a big problem down into manageable pieces, operate on each pieces and then put all the pieces back together. For example, you might want to fit a model to each spatial location or time point in your study, summarise data by panels or collapse high-dimensional arrays to simpler summary statistics. The development of plyr has been generously supported by BD (Becton Dickinson).

knitr: A general-purpose package for dynamic report generation in R

Read the [[http://yihui.name/knitr/][home page]]. It has great resources.

Watched [[https://www.screenr.com/qcv8][the video]]. Very nice to see; comfortable and familiar. Need to set up
RStudio for it. Clearly a critical tool. Cites Knuth.

Features are amazingly understated. If you've worked with all of these tools,
you will appreciate the importance of the author's effort!

=Objects=, =Options=, =Hooks=, and =Patterns= … what is this, Emacs?

There are demo [[http://yihui.name/knitr/demos][links]]. There is a [[https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples][project for examples]]. This [[http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/showcase/][showcase]] has links
to websites, book reviews, solutions, R packages, courses, workshops and
presentations, books, papers and reports, wrappers, and blog posts on =knitr=.

[[https://github.com/yihui/knitr][Here]] is the GitHub project. Read the motivations and see the hours and days and
weeks that you have had spared! Uses =testit=, so read up on that and added it.

Read the [[https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/FAQ.md][Frequently Asked Questions]]. Joined the [[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/knitr][mailing list]]. =ess= supports it.
Sure that I can configure the custom prompt. Great =README=.

[[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/index.html][CRAN]] as expected. Much better summary eg HTML, Makrdown, reStructuredText, and
AsciiDoc are mentioned. Curious about the cacheing, and how I would do it in
=org=. Custom code to run before and after a hunk are another thoughtful touch one
would expect coming from =org=. Also support Python and shell. The LaTeX and LyX
support is also pretty neat. Same [[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/README.html][READM]]E. [[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/knitr.pdf][Reference]].

- =attach= is a powerfuly convenient function. Sure, it can make you and your
  program go bonkers, but you know, it is worth it for the convenience. Joking
  aside, it has its place, so it should not go away completely. However, it ought
  not be used much, and if you do need to use it, the it should be really really
  obvious.
  - Eg: [fn:7ce54638: http://www.r-bloggers.com/to-attach-or-not-attach-that-is-the-question/]
#+NAME: C16F5A58-7869-4A3E-8651-B243CDE77E54
#+begin_src R
gcr$attach.unsafe <- attach
gcr$attach <- function(...) {
    warning("NEVER USE ATTACH! Use `unsafe.attach` if you must.")
    attach.unsafe(...)
}
#+end_src

- =library= reports issues immediately, and by design, =require= does not… remind
  the useR that they /may/ want the former not the latter
  - Via [fn:84031d95: http://www.r-bloggers.com/library-vs-require-in-r/]
  - Just like everything else here, this is a /personal preference/ thing!
#+NAME: FD2B4209-4312-4CD2-968F-84C66702E0A4
#+begin_src R
gcr$require <- function(...) {
    warning("Are you sure you wanted `require` instead of `library`?")
    base::require(...)
}

Sometimes you only want to list everything *but* functions [fn:7b11c35d: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13094324/hiding-function-names-from-ls-results-to-find-a-variable-name-more-quickly]:

Make it really simple to specify how to handle errors in a given session:

#+begin_src R
gcr$recoveronerror <- function() {
    options(error=recover)
}

gcr$recoveronerroroff <- function() {
    options(error=NULL)
}
#+end_src

Make it really simple to specify how to handle warnings in a given session:
#+NAME: BC7DAB81-7147-4239-BB7F-3AF6C2288B80
#+begin_src R
gcr$erroronwarn <- function() {
    options(warn=2)

gcr$erroronwarnoff <- function() {
    options(warn=0)
}
#+end_src

=sqldf= should always use =SQLite=.

#+NAME: D5C8CB56-C0C2-4524-8B86-9C0549F9D727
#+begin_src R
options(sqldf.driver = "SQLite")

Save your fingers from having to type =head= the next =n= thousand times [fn:f9fcc455: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13024167/how-to-make-head-be-applied-automatically-to-output] because I can't. =ess-rdired= and friends use the dataframe print function,
so I didn't make dataframes print using it.
#+NAME: 2C3CDAF3-8D92-44CD-9D00-513E05D53621
#+begin_src R
gcr$printdf <- function(df) {
    if (nrow(df) > 10) {
        print(head(df, 5))
        cat("---\n")
        print(tail(df, 5))
    } else {
        print(df)
    }
}
#+end_src

Sometimes you want to see all of the data in a dataframe, and sometimes you
don't. Make it really easy to change whenever you feel like it.

#+NAME: 32B3BE7D-6BF6-480C-AFFD-255CA71BE24B
#+begin_src R
gcr$printlen <- function(len=500) {
    options("max.print" = len)
}
#+end_src

When you've got =n=-thousand rows of data, make it easier to get a sample from it,
just make it specific and keep it simple.

#+NAME: C211CA1E-7322-41CA-A82C-ABA5FCD7C34E
#+begin_src R
gcr$hundred <- function(df, idx=0) {

For the time being, GUI work will only be performed on OSX so utilize OSX's
renderer [91578029: http://emacs.1067599.n5.nabble.com/unable-to-start-device-X11-td330804.html].

That worked fine until I actually starting using that graphics device!

Then even though I was on OSX I *had* to switch to =X11=.

<2014-11-05 Wed>
That was probably a mistake. The folks on-list said that =quartz= should be super.
Perhaps the error was between the keyboard and the chair, so I am switching
back.

<2014-11-08 Sat>
When I us =ggplot= and quarts on this system, it blows up.

<2014-11-25 Tue>
Switched to the official CRAN R build, which works fine on OSX.

Explicitly state the timezone. This could be done either here or in the =.profile=.
I'm not totally sure where to put it. Because I am trying to do *everything* with,
I will put it here. Perhaps this should get set via =Sys.setenv= instead? I'll
leave it for now and fix it later if necessary. I did test this out with a call
to =Sys.time()= and it worked correctly.
