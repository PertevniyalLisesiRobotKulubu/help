** Style Guide
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       orgmode:gcr:vela:STYLEGUIDE
  :END:

- Appearance.
  - Never override theme colors.
  - When the theme doesn't configure a face then submit a patch.
- Content
  - When importing update to conform with Style-Guide.
  - Keep tangled and weaved documents synchronized with their web.
  - Ask yourself:
    - Does it belong in this web?
    - Does it belong in this headline?
- Dictionary
  - Exemple Complet Minimal (ECM) :: The minimal complete example of expected
    versus actual behavior. [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.html][Source]].
  - Key-Bind :: A verb. The act of creating a Key Binding.
  - Literate Programming (LP) :: As Knuth intended.
  - Out of the Box (OOTB) :: The default configuration.
  - Sysop :: A proper noun. The System-Operator. The human operating this EMACS
    based Org-Mode enabled literate programming system. The reader.
  - Tangle :: A verb. Assemble a document for consumption by another program or
    machine.
  - Weave :: A verb. Prepare a document for consumption by a human.
  - Web :: A document contained Source-Block definitions that define a system.
- Encoding
  - Prefer Unicode characters over ASCII equivalents.
    - Note eventual switch form PDFLaTeX to LuaTeX.
  - Consider Org-Mode automatic handling of ASCII to UTF-8 symbols.
- File/Package Loading
  - Load every one with ~use-package~ whether it came with EMACS OOTB or ELPA.
    - ~ensure t~ tells the reader which one it came from.
  - Binding definitions often live in Piano Lessons.
  - Configurations aren't meant to be fully transplant-able because this system
    monolithic. In the interest of collaboration as much of the package
    configuration lives in the =use-package= block as possible.
- Formatting
  - Code Snippet.
    - Key bindings
    - Programming language expressions
      - Variable names
    - Emacs mode name
    - Class and Object names
    - Shell commands that are executable
    - Executables for programming language compilers and interpereters
      - ~gcc~ and ~python~
      - ~bash~ and ~perl~
      - ~scheme~ and ~java~
      - =GCC= and =Pyton=
      - =Bash= and =Perl=
      - =Scheme= and =Java=
    - Anything that you would read program or text
    - Use ~code style~ of tildaes
  - Non-Code Snippet.
    - File types
    - Concepts like =Object Oriented Programming= or a =Immediately-invoked
      function expression=
    - Use =verbatim= style of equal sign
  - Package.
    - Same as Headline.
    - Dashes separate definition.
    - Acronyms are all upper case to distinguish from words for example "GNU"
      vs "Gnu".
- Headline.
  - Be sure that every one has an =ID= property with a =UUID= value.
    - ~org-id-get-create~ does this. So does code in Hacking/Org Mode/Utility.
  - Capitalize: nouns, verbs, and adjectives.
  - Don't capitalize conjunctions unless they are starting the definition.
  - Sell this "chapter" to the reader.
  - Some headlines will be empty and significant; keep them.
    - Some modes don't require any configuration. The headline still needs to be
      present to remind the reader to keep it in her cognitive landscape.
      Configure other properties and modes taking it into account.
    - For every language under Hacking you should:
      - Only include it if it is valuable and you will invest adequate time to
        configure this well and use it well. When reading Org-Mode examples you
        will want to add Org-Mode language support because it is easy and fun
        and then you are left with an insufficiently configured environment.
        That is unacceptable.
      - Enable it in ~org-babel-load-languages~.
      - Read the user manual for it.
    - The =Prog*-Mode= system configuration can result in Headlines that don't
      need any configuration. The Headline still communicates the mode's
      value to the reader even if it doesn't configure EMACS.
  - It is important to include headlines that are empty and that you may not
    even end up keeping. You need them to help you explore the cognitive
    landscape with them present. In this one case, premature optimization is
    /not/ the root of all evil.
  - Sometimes headlines might better be:
    - List items.
    - Stand-alone bold text without punctuation.
- Hyperlink.
  - External.
    - Exclude those easily found with a search-engine unless you are willing to
      verify their existence frequently.
    - Include when they make the task at hand immensely easier.
  - Internal.
    - Minimize usage.
- Literate Programming.
  - Comments.
    - Exclude from tangle-blocks and rely on source-block for traceability.
  - Noweb-Ref.
    - Same as Headline.
    - Replace spaces with dashes.
    - Probably the Heading name.
    - Keep depth shallow
  - Weaver and mode configurations are tightly bound.
- Maintenance.
  - Frequently check spelling, grammar, and weasel-words.
  - Only keep working features in the system.
- Macros
  - Rendered as written-text.
  - Don't contain source code.
  - Create for ideas expressed more than 2 times.
  - Expanded during weaving, not during tangling.
- Plain List.
  - End single sentences with a period.
- Programming Language.
  - Emacs-Lisp.
    - Almost always use ~defun~ instead of ~advice-add~.
      - Functions are more normal and predictable.
      - Advice can subtly break without you noticing.
    - Parameter.
      - ~nil~ for =FALSE=.
      - ~t~ for =TRUE=.
      - ~n~ for numerical values.
    - Never ~custom-set-variables~.
    - Always use relative file paths.
    - Byte-compile frequently to minimize System warnings.
    - Prefer to byte-compile all references by using ~function~.
      - Fail-fast: it is better to know immediately if there are resolution
        issues.
    - Prefer to declare anonymous functions with ~function~.
    - [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Using-Lexical-Binding.html#Using-Lexical-Binding][Quoted via]].
    - If a non-special variable appears outside of a let form, the byte-compiler
      will warn about reference or assignment to a "free variable". An
      unused non-special variable binding within a let form provokes the
      byte-compiler will warn about an "unused lexical variable". The
      byte-compiler will also issue a warning if you use a special variable as a
      function argument.
- Source Block
  - Be sure that every one has a =NAME= property with a =UUID= value.
    - YASnippet =sc= does this. So does code in Hacking/Org Mode/Utility.
  - Tell the story in speech, and then in code.
  - Communicate the intent in written language as one paragraph and realize that
    intent in the next paragraph as a source block. Separate the two paragraphs
    like you would any other paragraph.
    - The exporter will probably separate the two as you would expect whether
      you separate the two entities with a space or not
  - When contained within a list:
    - Indent begin/end blocks with list content; this makes it clear to Org-Mode
      to export it as a code block.
  - Tangle =:file= should have the same =NAME=.
  - Virtually never edit the contents within buffer-of-origin.
    - Out of buffer edits:
      - Fast when spoken language.
      - Risky when LISP.
  - While similar to Org-Macro, the =RESULT= formatting indicates to the reader
    that the value is the result of an evaluation.
- Spelling
  - Place =LocalWords= at the beginning of the document. That way it won't get
    stomped on during development.
- Synonyms.
  - Document and System and Web.
    - A Web defines a system.
    - This document is a Web.
  - Weave and Export.
  - Sysop and Reader.
- Tangling.
  - When ordering matters, rely on block-reuse to enforce correct order.
- Voice.
  - Provide answers; do not pose questions or observations.
  - Simple and detailed.
  - Pleasant conversation style.
  - Audience is Sysop; the author included.
  - Capture decisions that allow this system to move forward.
- Weaving.
  - Strive to keep the weaving in synchronization with the tangling.
- Word Choice.
  - Use Arabic numerals.
  - Instead of writing "tells EMACS", communicate the result.
  - "EMACS" refers to the EMACS software
  - "HELP" refers to the system configured by tangling this we.
  - Never describe something as "perfect" or "delightful". If it is part of this
    system then it is perfect and delightful.

Provide a cross-platform command line shell that is a first-class EMACS citizen.

Commands input in eshell are delegated in order to an alias, a built in command,
an Elisp function with the same name, and finally to a system call. Semicolons
separate commands. =which= tells you what implementation will satisfy the call
that you are going to make. The flag =eshell-prefer-lisp-functions= does what it
says. =$$= is the result of the last command. Aliases live in
=eshell-aliases-file=. History is maintained and expandable. =eshell-source-file=
will run scripts. Since Eshell is not a terminal emulator, you need to configure
it for any commands that need to run using a terminal emulator by adding it to
to =eshell-visual-commands=.

You can use the usual machinery to work with the files. Highlight a region
and operation selections occur for all files in that region. Commands are
scheduled, and then executed, upon your command. Files can be viewed in modify
or read-only mode, too. There is an idea of =mark= in files, which is to select
them and perform operations on the marked files. There are helper methods for
most things you can think if like directories or modified-files or whatever,
meaning you can use regexen to mark whatever you like however you like. If that
suits you, then don't be afraid of using the regular expression builder
that is built into EMACS. Bulk marked file operations include additionally
copying, deleting, creating hard links to, renaming, modifying the mode,
owner, and group information, changing the time-stamp, listing the marked
files, compressing them, decrypting, verifying and signing, loading or byte
compiling them (Lisp files).

=g= updates the current buffer; =s= orders the listing by alpha or date-time.

=find-name-dired= beings the results back into Dired, which is nifty.

Wdired lets you modify files directly via the UI, which is interesting. Image-Dired
lets you do just that.

=+= creates a new directory. =dired-copy-filename-as-kill= stores the list of
files you have selected in the kill ring. =dired-compare-directories= lets you
perform all sorts of directory comparisons, a handy tool that you need once in
a while but definitely do need.

After dabbling, something happened that really changed my mind. These three
articles changed everything: [[http://www.masteringemacs.org/articles/2014/04/10/dired-shell-commands-find-xargs-replacement/][Dired Shell Command]], [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/working-multiple-files-dired][
Working with multiple files in dired]], and [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/wdired-editable-dired-buffers][WDired: Editable Dired Buffers]]..
They just made the power of Dired so obvious, and so easy to use, that it
instantly because delightful to use. That was very, very cool. Even though I
was really, really happy with Finder and Explorer... suddenly it just became so
obvious and pleasant to use Dired. That is so wild.

Key notes when executing shell commands on file selection...

Substitution:
- =<cmd> ?= :: 1* calls to cmd, each file a single argument
- =<cmd> *= :: 1 call to =cmd=, selected list as argument
- =<cmd> *""= :: have the shell expand the * as a globbing wild-card
  - Not sure what this means

Synchronicity:
- =<cmd> ...= :: by default commands are called synchronously
- =<cmd> &= :: execute in parallel
- =<cmd> ;= :: execute sequentially, asynchronously
- =<cmd> ;&= :: execute in parallel, asynchronously

Key notes on working with files in multiple directories... use the following:

Use =find= just like you would at the command line and all of the results show
up in a single Dired buffer that you may work with just like you would any other
file appearing in a Dired buffer. The abstraction here becomes so obvious, you
may ask yourself why you never considered such a thing /before/ now (as I did):

Noting that:
- =find-dired= :: is the general use case
- =find-name-dired= :: is for simple, single string cases

And if you want to use the faster Elisp version, that uses lisp regex, use:
- =find-lisp-find-dired= :: for anything
- =find-lisp-find-dired-subdirectories= :: for only directories

Key notes on working with editable buffers...

As the author notes, you probably already instinctually knew what is possible.
After reading his brief and concise exposition, it would be hard /not/ to
intuit what is possible! The options are big if you make a writable file buffer.
Think about using multiple cursors. Done? Well, that is a no-brainer. Once you
grok multiple cursors just =find-dired= what you need and then do what you need
to do to it. Very cool.

- =dired-toggle-read-only, C-x C-q= :: cycle between dired-mode and wdired-mode
- =wdired-finish-edit, C-c C-c= :: commit your changes
- =wdired-abort-changes, C-c ESC= :: revert your changes

When you selected a bunch of files or directories, you /may/ want to communicate
somewhere your selection somehow. The simplest way to do this is to utilize
=dired-copy-filename-as-kill=. What a nice idea, and its default binding is =w=.

Since I started using a menu bar again, and wanting to get Imenu really
exercised, Dired in Imenu seems like an obvious choice.

This system configures ~text-mode~ and ~prog-mode~ very similarly:

- EMACS *exists* to help you work with text.
- EMACS' entire configuration helps you work with text whether it is in a
  specific mode or not.
- Org-Mode's motto is "*Organize Your Life In Plain Text!*".
- From an EMACS and a LP perspective ~text-mode~ *is a* programming mode.
- In this system: *Text is the User-Interface*.

This system does not rely on ~prog-mode~ inheritance to configure it's hacking
modes:

- The EMACS literature advises that modes extend ~text-mode~ or ~prog-mode~
- That /would/ make it easier to configure nearly everything using ~prog-mode-hook~.
- In practice ~prog-mode~ is too new.
- Not all programming modes inherit from it. Not even =IELM= is ready.

With that in mind this system:

- Defines common configuration here for reuse in every desired mode starting
  with =text-mode= and then all logical programming modes.
- Explicitly utilizes it directly instead of using inheritance.
- This system refers to this configuration of programming modes as =prog*-mode=.
- The line between "configuring EMACS", "configuring ~text-mode~", and
  "configuring ~prog*-mode~" is often blurred and sometimes confusing. The lines
  become wavy and intertwined with mastery of EMACS and LP.

When source blocks are evaluated, their results get stored in a result area,
typically for display. If the results are small, they are displayed with colons
instead of an =example= block. Instead, *always* place them in an
example block. This makes exports more consistent and other Org-Mode features seem
to behave more predictably.

    - What needs to be done? TODO
    - What is being done right now? IN-PROGRESS
    - What is waiting because an external agent? HELD-BLOCKED
    - What is waiting because I have put it on hold? HELD-FROZEN
    - What is waiting until another date? (although I'm not using the Agenda) HELD-UNTIL

    - What is complete? DONE
  - Version 02
    - Questions about every state
      - When was it created?
        - The purpose of its creation is contained within its Headline and its
          contents "when?" and "why?" aren't required
      - When was it changed and why?
        - The reason for the change is probably in the body of the Headline so
          why bother keeping a note here? Bother because it makes it easier to
          review the state-change of a task because
          - It probably isn't worth keeping in the task long-term (it is
            transient)
            - But it still matters and I want to know about it
          - If it is worth keeping in the task long-term then it will be there
            but
            - It makes it easier to review the modification of a task without
              - Having to re-read the entire task to understand the context
              - Track down the why it modified
      - When did it complete (done or not) and why?
        - The goals for completion are probably in the body of the Headline
          itself so why keeping a note here? Bother because it makes it easier
          to review the completion of a task without
          - Having to re-read the entire task to understand the context
          - Track down the why it completed

I wrote my first to-do list on a funeral home notepad. It was either that or
it was from the furniture store. My dad worked at both. The National Selected
Morticians logo sat somewhere on its pages. There wasn't much for me to note
back then and the notepad worked fine. When I got a little older I graduated
to a Mead spiral notebook. I wasn't organized and wasted space. When you tore
out the pages they made a mess. At home we had two computers over the years an
Apple 2E and then a IBM PC compatible. Mom used PFS Write on the 2E and I used
Notepad once in a while but my usage on both games. They were at home but they
were not my home. The mad was my home until college where I made two new
friends: Composition Book (CB) and Bill Joy's ~vi~. CB seemed like an elegant
upgrade from the Mead spiral but it didn't last. CB's lines were too tall and
the pages were too short, the worst of both worlds. The speckled black and
white covers were its most useful part which was it's beauty as no one would
ever have guessed. Compared to the Mead, the CB's were downright elegant. That
leaves ~vi~. Mrs. Marian Manyo prepared a handout to help us learn ~vi~. It was a
single page. ~SunOS~ was at a whopping version of 5.7 yet the handout left ink
on your finger suggesting that it a mimeograph instead of a Xerox that
deposited it into our awaiting writing fingers. It has seven commands that I
learned: open, close, save, close and save, insert and command mode. That
worked to store my todo list for years. This as before CVS usurped RCS so
backups were basic. My workflow had two states: existence and non-existence.
Simple. This well for another nineteen years. Until I followed the GTD
approach but in a simpler ad-hock form. Emacs was never part of my life
even when it lived next door to vi. Growing up on the cusp of beefy IDEs
living on puny desktops most schools weren't rooted in the tradition of LISP
and Emacs and I never joined it. Scheme got my attention though and it sucked
me into Emacs, but it didn't keep me. Twice I tried. Nope. Three times I tried
and at the end I liked Emacs a little bit worse. Then something funny happened:
I wanted to learn OCaml. Emacs was the only good editor for it, so I dug up
Emacs. Then I wanted to learn SML and go figure: Emacs was the only good
editor for it. The same story was retold ten or fifteen times. The proverbial
lotus kept expanding every time you touched because not only did satisfy your
ideas but it gave you new ones. Totally hooked, I am still keeping my todo
lists in ASCII text files. Then three years I heard about Org-Mode. My first
Org file had you guessed it: lists converted into headings. Oops, that wasn't
right so I converted them all to lists. That worked well for years. Then I got
interested in publishing and spent another year with headings and lists. A
year or so ago I got tired of my ad-hock workflow I checked if Org had a way
to deal with workflow. Of course it did! Then I got interested in tracking
state changes, and of course it had that. Beautiful. This whole story lives
here to introduce refile. When I moved headings I moved them by selecting the
whole subtree, killing it, and pasting it somewhere else. Fifteen or twenty
times I lost the heading. Sure VCS saved it but it was a hassle and a mess, a
total frustration. My error was not marking the entire subtree. Oops. When I
searched for a solution I ended up on the refile page. Of course that is how
you do it. Now /what/ was the /it/ that I wanted to do?

Three or four Org-Mode files sit open in buffers for the entire year. Once in
a while there are new ones added but they usually replace one of the original
four. Exceptions are one-offs like provisioning scripts for my systems at work
or at home. Rarely a heading grows so large that it graduates to its own file.
This is by design: I refuse to pre-optimize and grow a menagerie files to
house every ever taxonomy conceivable only to end up retiring the file having
closed only a single heading.

Here is how my usage looks to me:
- 99.00% of the time I am working in the same three files
  - Refiling across subtrees at level two
- <00.90% of the time I am moving headings to level zero, or the top level of the
  document
- <00.09% of the time I am moving headings into a different file

My predictable and small usage makes for an easy system configuration goal
below.

When edit mode is exited, the option exists to automatically remove empty
opening and closed lines for the source block. Never do this. The thing is that
I forgot why. When I was working on a recent analysis with R there was a
space appearing in the opening and closing line of the source block that didn't
appear in the source editing buffer. That surprised me. I am sure that I've
forgotten why this is the case. I don't like it because you add a bunch of
empty lines in the source buffer for every source block. With that in mind I
will enable this feature and try it out again.

The source block buffer may be configured to appear in a few different places.
For a while I really liked =reorganize-frame= because sometimes you want to be
able to see the code you are editing in edition to the rest of the document. At
least that is what I am telling myself. Once I learned you could change it I
realized that 1 I should have asked if it could be changed and 2 I should have
changed it. The flow that I've got configured here is that you are either in the
source document where code blocks are not highlighted or you are in the source
block so you are editing in a buffer that is full-fledged HELP. That is the best
way so you can focus completely on each task at hand in the ideal mode for that
task. Anything else results in distractions and errors.

Org-Mode has a really nice feature that hitting =C-c C-c= will generally just do
the /right thing/. It is really nice. That feature extends to source blocks of
course. Ironically I had a typo here, typing /of curse/ instead of /of course/.
The thing is that you really, really need to develop a personal workflow, and
then configure the tool to enable it. The more I learn about Org-Mode, the more
leery I am about making it really easy to evaluate code. I want it to be a
really, really specific and decided action to evaluate a code block, so don't
make it so easy as =C-c C-c=.

Configure the system to successfully use ~vc-next-action~ while editing a
Source-Block. Before perfoming the edit, check if it is Org-Mode and
exit the Source-Block Buffer (SBB). If this system stays in the SBB
when calling ~vc-next-action~ the entire contents of the buffer are escaped
as Org-Mode source code upon returning to the source buffer (this). Do the same
thing before any version control modes that would result in the same condition.

Started questioning why after hitting RETURN while in lists I have to hit TAB to
get indented properly. Kind of a dead giveaway that I should be
return-and-indenting! Looked at =org-return= to find that it has an argument
about indenting and then saw that =org-return-indent= passes it for you. With that
in mind, RETURN is bound to that now. Now HELP has four different kinds of
"returns" in Org in order of likelihood of usage:

- org-return-indent :: Make it really easy to work in existing list items,
  headings, and tables
  - This is listed first because I often go back to modify entries
  - <return> because it is used the most
- org-meta-return :: Make it really easy to add new list items, headings, and
  table contents
  - M-<return> because the binding comes with Org
- electric-indent-just-newline :: For when I want to break out of the default
  Org indentation to start working at the beginning of the line for example when
  I'm done working in a list or have just created a new heading
  - C-M-<return> because it is next step "lower" in the binding
- help/smart-open-line :: When I want to insert a new line between the current
  and next line then position the cursor correctly indented at the start of it.
  - s-<return> because it is that is the last place in the modifier key chain

next char is a symbol or closed paren.

These functions are mentioned, and I am not sure where or how to use them yet,
but Vitalie Spinu mentioned them as being useful:

- =comint-previous-matching-input-from-input=
- =comint-history-isearch-backward-regexp=

For a while I used =ess-eval-buffer-and-go=, but now I know that it is insanely
faster to use =ess-eval-buffer= instead. Previously I've read people saying that,
and it is true.

*Philosophy*

The current =ESS= maintainers philosophies about how to maintain an R code-base
make sense to me and are virtually the same as my own. Quite simply, the rule is
that the code artifacts are the single source of system definition. Consequently,
the system should be configured in this manner:

We want to keep dump files after loading them; never delete them. The idea
is that if we use them, then they are a valid part of the system definition and
need to be kept.

#+NAME: orgmode:gcr:vela:F0740222-26A5-4DA0-9C60-6EC04DCCDDFB
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results output silent
(setq ess-keep-dump-files +1)
#+END_SRC

=ESS= allows us to quite easily modify live R objects and functions. It provides
this functionality via =ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer=. These changes are
considered to be experimental, and not part of the master record according to
our philosophy. As such, we don't care to know that these new versions ever
existed and their record will be forgotten from history. In other words, that
new, modified version of the object or function, is never saved to a file for
later reuse.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results output silent
(setq ess-delete-dump-files nil)
#+END_SRC

Since our systems are entirely file-based, the entirety of the system most
likely lives in different files. Before loading any file for sourcing, save
any ESS source buffers. This approach is in addition to two other things:
(1) Emacs is auto-saving every file buffer quite frequently and (2) there is
advice before every manual =eval= call so that the buffers and their files stay
in sync. Yes, it is really that important.

#+NAME: orgmode:gcr:vela:252643D9-4FC2-4037-BAF8-5F6043D02C5A
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results output silent
(setq ess-mode-silently-save +1)
#+END_SRC

=ESS= executes code in another process. That is no secret. When displaying output
from that code running in another process though, it can look like Emacs is
locking up. That is not the case: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2770523/how-can-i-background-the-r-process-in-ess-emacs.
What is happening that Emacs is waiting for the output. Configure this mode to
continue to accept user input, which is obviously critical, but don't wait for
the process to provide its output. Instead, all output is printed after the last
input lines. What we gain is perceived speed, and what we lose is the nice
sequential this/that/this/that we get from a typical REPL interaction. As I
write this, I'm not totally sure how this will work, but the documentation and
post are consistent and describe what I had wanted here so I will give it a try
and see how it goes.

When =ess= starts, or when R starts, it takes the current directory as its

is an intentional line-break after the closing round bracket because that is the

I enjoy writing letters. I enjoy reading letters. LaTeX produces letters that
are easy to print and read. Org provides a [[http://orgmode.org/worg/exporters/koma-letter-export.html][KOMA Script exporter]] for [[https://www.ctan.org/pkg/koma-script?lang%3Den][KOMA-script]].
The Org documentation mentions that the user should read the [[http://orgmode.org/cgit.cgi/org-mode.git/plain/contrib/lisp/ox-koma-letter.el][ox-koma-letter.el]]
header documentation.

The [[https://www.ctan.org/pkg/babel?lang%3Den][babel]] packages is mentioned in the Org documentation. The package
documentation explains that it should be used with LaTeX, but not XeTeX. Some
time ago I decided to stick with LaTeX. This decision needs documentation. This
system leans towards LuaTeX because of its Unicode support and sticks with
PDFLaTeX because of its broad acceptance. Those two goals are at odds with each
other.

Load the KOMA exporter.

- Understanding KOMA and how to use it
  - There are 4 ways to set letter metadata, listed "from the most specific to
    the most general" (not sure exactly what this statement means, and the conclusion of my notes tries to make sense of what is really going on here and what is the best way to do things)
    - Org option lines (ORG)
    - Separate Org latex classes (LTX)
    - Emacs Lisp variables (LISP)
    - Letter Class Option files (LCO)
- Notes and thoughts on the ways to use it
  - LTX
    - By following the setup directions, you do this, creating "help-letter" class
    - Familiar and easy if you already know LaTeX
      - At some point in your workflow, you *must* define a class to use, anyway
    - Very easy to do, just define the class template and set =org-koma-letter-default-class=
  - ORG
    - Simple way that makes it very easy to just focus on the document content
    - This metadata takes highest priority in the workflow
      - So you should set your typical defaults in LISP or LCO and customize it
        here. This is exactly what I wanted to know.
      - This lets you do your tweaking in each unique file while relying on the
        most common defaults defined elsewhere
  - LISP
    - Very familiar style of configuring things
  - LCO
    - LCO == Letter Class Option files
    - LCO files are TeX
    - They are included in the generated TeX source code from the letter
    - Gives *full* access to KOMA-Script
      - Big deal, because not everything is exposed through ORG or LISP
      - Also gives full access to any and all TeX and LaTeX code
    - LCO files are a KOMA-Script thing, so they are a LaTeX thing
    -
      #+begin_quote
      Letter metadata set in LCO files overwrites letter metadata set in Emacs
      variables but not letter metadata set in the Org file.
      #+end_quote
    - When you include multiple LCO files, they are evaluated LIFO. Properties
      are set as they first appear, and are not set again. Say you include
      "MyGeneralStuffForAnyLetter.lco" and then include
      "MyStuffSpecificToThisLetter.lco". The specific stuff will get set first.
      Then general stuff will get set last.
      - Surely there is a better way to phrase this. I will work on that.
- Recommendations
  - What is the easiest way to start using KOMA-Script based on what you know
    today?
  - If you don't know any of the approaches
    - Then choose between learning LaTeX and Org
  - If you only know LaTeX
    - Then you will use the LTX/LCO metadata approach
  - If you only know ORG
    - Then you will use the ORG metadata approach
  - If you only know ORG and LISP
    - Then you will use the LISP approach for general metadata and the ORG
      approach specific metadata
  - If you know LTX/LCO, ORG, and LISP
    - Then you have total flexibility
    - The fact is that
      - ORG settings always trump LTX/LCO and LISP
      - LISP settings are a subset of all of the settings available in
        KOMA-Script, so you will always have to fall back to LTX/LCO if you want
        to use unexposed features
      - LCO files are just plain old LaTeX, which you already know
    - So the best thing to do
      - Is to use ORG for letter-specific settings
      - And LTX for general settings
      - Everything is a lot simpler this way because
        - One less metadata approach to keep track of
        - All KOMA-Script features are present
        - Need to learn details of KOMA-Script package anyway

Configure the default class.

The nlinum gutter should not "shift" as it transitions between line numbers of
different magnitudes. For example going from line 99 to 100 will shift the
buffer contents by one character. That is distracting and interrupts the flow.

to be crystal clear that the prompt line in comint buffers would be read only.
This turned out to be a mistake; though I am not sure why, when, or how it
became a mistake. Nonetheless, this should be left alone. The way the issue here
manifested was that all R buffers opened by =ess= were 100% read only which
obviously is a *big issue* if you actually want to use! ROFL

Every EMACS user ought to have a [[http://shop.fsf.org/product/gnu-emacs-reference-mugs/][Emacs Reference Mug]] at their desk. The mug
invites other users to ask questions. Give the mug as a gift to every user you
know who would benefit from learning EMACS. The mug reminds us all that EMACS is
the perfect configuration of EMACS. It is available on every machine. When you
break your system, you can always fall back to the good and reliable default
EMACS configuration to get your system up and running again. The OOTB
configuration of EMACS is one of the most important system configurations that
you will every find. That is why it is important never to ruin it.

This system wants to maximize accessibility for new users. It wants anyone to be
able to download and use it without surprises. It wants the mug to serve as a
fine reference for anyone to use. It wants to keep things simple and familiar so
that anyone who has learned EMACS OOTB can use it pleasantly and productively.
These goals are essential to configuring the keyboard for this system. This
system will always respect the POLA.

Every system requires an output. You have two options. The first is a terminal
that only displays characters. The second is a display that provides detailed
graphics. "Display" is the EMACS term for a GUI.

Some users prefer the former. Some users prefer the latter. Some users prefer to
use a $4000USD machine to emulate the latter. Both are good options.

This system is configured to work pleasantly for either type of output.

  - Single key presses are easy there.
- Table-bang the shift, caps-lock and enter keys.
  - Table-bang is a position of your hand. Make it by:
    - Starting with your hands in the home position.
    - Make a "high-five" with both of them parallel to the keyboard.
    - Turn your left hand counter-clockwise and right hand clockwise to make
      them perpendicular to the keyboard.
    - Squeeze all of your fingers together.
    - Push the keys using the side of your Pinky.
    - In this position you are using the strength of all of your fingers.
  - Never use those key using your Pinky alone.
  - Practice depends 100% on user-discipline.
- Try to achieve balance with meta keys.
  - Provide same key of each side of the keyboard.
- Be conscious of key operations [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_key_notation_return_vs_RET.html][on different outputs]].
  - Always provide both.
  - Note what is getting stomped on.
  - For return bind to:

*** Understanding Your Cognitive Landscape.

You operate within a cognitive landscape. Every moment you are in a single
=place=. While residing in each =place= you perform logically related =activities=.
Activities facilitate logical actions like modification within that =place=.
Modifications are performed objects. Objects include things like the contents of
a buffer, contents of memory, or the file that backs a buffer. While performing
those =activities= there is a logical sense of "flow". That should never be
interrupted. Usually an interruption occurs when you are going to go to a new
=place=. The =distance= between =places= is measured in the similarity between the
=actions= that you find there. As you develop these ides it will be obvious where
key-bindings should go

*** Key-Bindings Take You to Places to Perform Activities
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       orgmode:gcr:vela:E765C8BB-ECC3-4791-A287-83B6DED2F6C3
    :END:

OOTB you wil be visiting many =places= and performing many =activities=. EMACS comes
with a good configuration that minimizes =distance=. This isn't worth changing.
You can use EMACS for a lifetime without ever having to customize any of the
key-bindings. This is what lets anyone use your system. This is what lets you
use the system with =-Q= when you break it. You need to decide if you every want
to alter the default configuration. This system does not want to. It wants to
keep EMACS true to EMACS and your hands happy. To satisfy those goals the
following practices were defined.

- 99.999% of the time never bind to the =C= or =M= name-space.
  - They are for system key-bindings. You can break them. Don't.
  - In theory =C-c= is the "user name-space" but packages stomp on this all of the
    time anyway so don't use it.
  - Some bindings are just too valuable to pass up:
    - =C-;=
      - Your hands are in the home position already.
    - Every modifier key with return.
- Never bind to =F= keys.
  - They are a painful stretch on most keyboards.
  - Some require a lone Pinky with is worse.
  - Most operating systems bind actions to them OOTB anyway.
  - EMACS comes with key-bindings OOTB.
- Don't try to set up a Hyper-key.
- Use shift as a name-space expansion vehicle.
  - Shift doubles every name-space in which you use it.
  - Use cautiously, not every name-space vehicle supports it.
- About the =s= (super) name-space.
  - In theory it is the best place for user-defined key-bindings because
    EMACS OOTB uses =C= and =M= completely leaving =s= mostly open.
  - In practice =C= and =M= are running out of space because there are a lot of
    new packages being added to EMACS. Most new packages are binding key
    in the =s= name-space.
  - This system reserves =s= completely for Sysop.

These practices say nothing about the =places= or =activities= that you choose to
peform. The practices only look at the key-binding configuration. There are a
limited number of keys on a keyboard and there are physical limitations on your
hands. Along with the previous assuptions it may look like there are less.
Fortunately it just looks that way and it isn't true. There are a lot of
powerful ways to "go places" with EMACS. The next heading contains my attempt.

*** How to Get There Pleasantly and Quickly
    :PROPERTIES:

    :END:

You need to learn how to use EMACS. You need to develop a personal preference.
You need to develop an idea of =places= and =activities= and =distance=. The following
headings are delineated by breaks in flow.

The examples try to talk about doing those things and do it by exploring:

- "going places to do things".
- "how quickly I will get there and how long I will be there"
- "how quickly I want to go somewhere else".

They were initially described by the properties:

- Actions :: The number of related actions in that place.
- Expertise :: The level of skill and speed with which you are performing the
  activity.
- Relationship :: How closely those activities are related in the current place.
- Frequency :: How many times you perform these actions when you here.

The relationship between "doing those things" and those 4 properties is still
unclear and being explored.

      :END:

- =Actions= here are for the =place= inside of the buffer itself. They are for
  immediate acting upon the contents of the buffer. They are logically
  related, used frequently, and likely to be memorized.
- When you come here, you are likely to stay for some time before getting
  out.
- Only use single key bindings; anything more may be a new logical
  name-space and may use a Hydra.
- Split the home sides of the keyboard in half.
- The left side of the keyboard should be use for operations common to
  every mode.
  - For example ~goto-line~ and ~ispell~.
  - It has 15 bindings available; 20 if you use 1-5. 40 if you shift them.
- The right side of the keyboard should be used operations specific to the
  current major mode.
  - For example in Org-Mode navigating between source-blocks and
    evaluating them.
  - It has 19 bindings available; 26 if you use 6-=. 52 if you shift them.

For example, in Org-Mode:

- I traverse the entire document very quickly with
  ~org-babel-previous-src-block~ and and ~org-babel-next-src-block.~
- I execute source-blocks.
- I edit source-blocks.

Every activity is related to reading, modifying, executing, and tangling code.

**** =Key-Chord=
     :PROPERTIES:

     :END:

Key-Chord is intriguing because it works on every keyboard. It is powerful
because it can you bring you to any =place= easily. It is good for taking you
places in two differnt kinds of scenarios.

One example is grammar-checking. There are a few ways to do that. I don't
remember them all. In a given mode I want to see a list of all the ways.
I really just want to see all of the stuff that I value for a given mode and
don't use frequently.

Another example are things that I value for a mode and use a lot but are not
logically related to other activities in that place. For example moving the
mark around and going to lines are performed a lot so they need to be done
quickly and left. This is a place where key-chords and the shift modifier are
a fast and intuitive way to go places.

***** Single-Key Key-Chord Name-Space.

- Nice if you don't mind hitting the same key twice.
- You will use come here often, perform your single =action=, and be done
  and leave very frequently and quickly.
- Using alphabetical characters always results in unpleasant surprises.
- Harder for breakage but it still occurs.
  - =#FF= color code.
  - =cc= carbon copy.
  - =JJ= nick-name.
  - =dd= add
- Symbols are more likely to be safer bets.
  - Only use the symbols.
    - 8 if you use rows 3-4; 16 if you shift.
    - Fifth row has 13; 26 with shift.
- Good vehicle to reach a Hydra.

- Very attractive.
- Nice if you don't like hitting the same key twice.
- Easy to use all fingers.
  - Finger strength is not an issue here; use any of them.
- Unexpected breakage very easy.
  - =cd= in ~=eshell=~.
- Use sparingly.
- Not worth analyzing ideal combinations; just use it and see if it
  doesn't break.
- Bringing over existing bindings. They are all for every mode so I will
  keep it that way.

- Sometimes you want to do something in a =place= but you aren't sure what
  and you aren't sure where you will go next from there. For example you
  might want to perform an Org-Mode =action= that is important but you don't
  really use much. For example exporting to HTML might not be common for
  you but you value.
- =Hydras= can be used for very related actions too. The difference between
  the =s= name-space is the distance between them and where you are now.
  In the =s= namespace you go there very quickly. For =Hydras= sometimes you
  can get the fast and sometimes more slowly. They are complementary to
  every name-space.
- =SHIFT= doubles your key-space.
- Use =C-g= to exit the Hydra.

For example, in Org-Mode I am still learning about functions and haven't used
them much and forget their names. It is faster to put them in a Hydra. If they
get used a lot, I will add them to =s=.

*** Building Your Own Keyboard

As your mastery of EMACS grows so too will your desire to build your own
keyboard. It is natural. As you explore various dimensions of expression you
will have a lot of fun. You will act more quickly and skillfully. Even with the
goals of this system in place the desire grows.

3D printing is one area worth exploring. A lot of EMACS users design and print
their own custom keyboards. That looks very fun. [[http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id%3Dnrsi&id%3Dukelele][Ukulele]] is softer way to
explore your keyboard. Reading its user manual is important. It contains ideas
about stack-able-environments for bindings. You may use Ukulele or Hydras to do
the same thing. [[https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/][Karabiner]] is a nice way to re-map your keys. It's easiest
adjustment is to make return act as return when pressed alone and as control
when pressed with another key. That introduces a symmetry to your keyboard which
can be helpful. All of those dimensions are worth exploring.

When I explored them I felt that they led me further away from the majority of
users. Every time explored a different key-mapping (not key-binding) it reduced
accessibility for new users. Each time I tried to work around that hiccup. The
last pursuit was =;= and space.

It would be great to set up your keyboard with the meta keys on the bottom
like this:

Karabiner was too slow for my typing speed though. It [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/38qllb/karabiner_space_as_control/][happens]]. It seemed like a
minimal change to use Ukelele to:

- Make space send =C=
- Make =;= send space
- Make ='= a dead key
  - In it's dead key state make
    - =;= \rarr =;=
    - =:= \rarr =:=
    - ='= \rarr ='=
    - ="= \rarr ="=

The trouble is that it violates the POLA. Therefore, I left it alone and stuck
with a simple "Get C on both sides".

That has worked out very well. It is very easy to do on every operating system.
It holds true to the values of this system. When you develop an idea of =places= and
how often you go there the key-mapping becomes more obvious. Make it easy to get
to key-bindings that take you to familiar places. For this system it is the home
keys, =s=, and =key-chord=. Make those keys more easily accessible. =C= and =M= often
have symmetric-definitions. =s= and =SHIFT= also often have symmetric definitions in
this system (mostly through Key-Chords). Therefore those key-mappings are kept
close together

On OS X Dyalog uses an input source for entering APL symbols. Enable its input
source, press option-i, and you get the symbol ⍳ (APL FUNCTIONAL SYMBOL IOTA).
It should work in every OS X application. When I tried to use it in Emacs
though it didn't work. This configuration swallows the option key and
translates it to the Emacs Super key. Any option chords are never sent to
OS X. This had worked fine because I'd never used command. Most of the time I
want Emacs to work this way, but some of the time I want to pass command
through to OS X. How can I do this?

When I read the Emacs documentation they explained that you can choose whether
or not you want ALT or GUI (option and command on OS X) to be swallowed by
Emacs or passed through to the OS. Most of us already have this in our config.
How can we switch it back and forth then?

Elisp is of course the solution so I wrote some code to toggle this behavior.
It didn't work! Didn't look like a bug in my code so I dug a little further
into the documentation. Around the same time I was reading the USB HID
specification. The spec explains that for every modifier there is both a left
and a right code. When I got to the relevant document for Emacs it all started
to make sense: the toggling modifier keys in Emacs only works for the right
keys!

It is exciting to learn that Emacs makes this distinction. What I found next
though was that it only works when the OS tells Emacs which modifier it is,
but not from Karabiner. It makes sense, Emacs expects to be told at a lower
level than Karabiner runs. Long story short I had to change the layout to get
the toggling behavior that I wanted.

For simplicity I added a Hydra to toggle both the option and the function key
between being sent to the OS or swallowed by Emacs.

Function started making a place in my config as Hyper after I got tired of
searching for combinations of Hydras for common actions.

These changes helped guide the custom keyboard design.
