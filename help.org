* Literate Programming

This system enables you to perform 3 Literate Document activities. These
activities combine to provide a rich Literate Programming environment. Their
configuration is defined with more granularity here to make sense of how the
system is configured, where, and how it works. These activities are not
performed interactively by the user. They are automatic operations that occur
as a result of the configuration of the document itself.

The following is the guide for the default configuration of this system and how
it behaves.

Key:

- Columns
  - S :: Source document modified?
  - W :: Destination weaved-document modified?
  - T :: Destination tangled-document modified?
  - E :: Evaluation occurred?

| Activity   | S | W | T | E |
|------------+---+---+---+---|
| Tangling   | F | F | T | F |
| Evaluating | T | F | F | T |
| Exporting  | F | T | F | F |

They are separate and distinct operations and are defined as such.

The last logical action is the activity of "Programming". It is a combination of
three 3 activities listed above combined with the configuration of EMACS to do
so. This is an interactive activity performed Sysop. The other 3 are not
interactive.

** Org-Mode Exemple Complet Minimal
   :PROPERTIES:
   :noweb-ref: Org-Mode-ECM
   :END:

A stable version of Org-Mode is provided OOTB. It's release cycle is tied to
EMACS release cycle. To get hot-fixes, cutting edge features, and easy patch
creation though, you need to use the version from Git.

The [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Installation.html][directions]] of how to run Org-Mode from Git are detailed and clear. The only
thing worth mentioning again is that in order to use *any* version of Org-Mode
other than the one that comes OOTB you *must* load Org-Mode *before* anything else
in your initialization file. This can be surprisingly easy to do! When you get
unexpected Org-Mode behavior be sure to stop and investigate ~org-version~ and
decide whether or not it is what you expect and prepare an ECM if necessary.

Add the Org-Mode core distribution the load path.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/org-mode/lisp")
#+END_SRC

Add the Org-Mode-Contributions distribution to the load path. The contributions
are critical to and inseparable from the core distribution.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/org-mode/contrib/lisp")
#+END_SRC

This system allows for single-character alphabetical bullet lists. For Org-Mode
to provide that, the following property must exist before Org-Mode is even
loaded. This configuration must occur here. *Never* remove this from a submitted
ECM.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-list-allow-alphabetical t)
#+END_SRC

Load Org-Mode.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'org)
#+END_SRC

Org-Mode already uses the guillemot for demarcating noweb references, but it
does it using the work-around of just using less-than and greater-than
characters twice. That is fine. Because EMACS supports Unicode just fine though,
configure Org-Mode to use the real symbol. Another option would be to configure
Pretty-Mode. This is in the ECM section because so that I can verify behavior of
my code.

** Tangling
   :PROPERTIES:
   :noweb-ref: Org-Mode-Tangle
   :END:

There is a way to disable property inheritance that speeds up tangling a lot.
This is only for user-defined properties; *not* Org-Mode properties.

The problem is that you lose property inheritance which is unacceptable. Never,
never allow that. Its inconsistent with how Org-Mode works.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-babel-use-quick-and-dirty-noweb-expansion nil)
#+END_SRC

*** Comments

Provide as much information as possible in the tangled artifact about the
origin artifact.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(help/set-org-babel-default-header-args :comments "noweb")
#+END_SRC

*** Padline

~org-babel-tangle-jump-to-org~ requires padded lines. This configuration could
arguably appear in the "Programming" heading because it impacts operation. It
lives here because it *must* occur as part of the Tangling activity so that it
can be used in the Programming activity.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(help/set-org-babel-default-header-args :padline "yes")
#+END_SRC

*** Noweb

Expand noweb references in source-blocks before:

| Activity   | Expand |
|------------+--------|
| Tangling   | T      |
| Evaluating | T      |
| Exporting  | F      |

This embraces the notion that you are telling the right thing to the
computer and the right thing to the human. By the time you get to exporting, you
ought to refer to the generated document.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(help/set-org-babel-default-header-args :noweb "no-export")
#+END_SRC

** Evaluating
   :PROPERTIES:

Install OB-SML.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

#+END_SRC

*** Eval

Never evaluate source-blocks or in-line-source-blocks on export.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(help/set-org-babel-default-header-args :eval "never-export")
(help/set-org-babel-default-inline-header-args :eval "never-export")
#+END_SRC

Be sure to never evaluate in-line-source-blocks on export.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-export-babel-evaluate nil)
#+END_SRC

*** Results

This system stores the results of evaluation in the source document. It believes
that the results are critical to the research.

Always display results like you would seem them in a REPL. For source-blocks
this means an =output= display and for in-line-source-blocks it means a =value=
display.

Replace theme each time you evaluate the block.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(help/set-org-babel-default-header-args :results "output replace")
(help/set-org-babel-default-inline-header-args :results "value replace")
#+END_SRC

** Weaving
   :PROPERTIES:

Load Htmlize for HTML export. Use it. Use in-line CSS.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

#+END_SRC

Load Beamer for creating reports.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

#+END_SRC

Load Markdown export for system compatibility.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'ox-md)
#+END_SRC

Make sure that exported files are Unicode UTF-8.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-export-coding-system 'utf-8)
#+END_SRC

Do not preserve line-breaks when exporting instead let the destination
format handle it as it sees fit. This doesn't work like I had expected and makes
me wonder what I am confused about here. When I export to HTML text containing
linebreaks no longer has linebreaks. This is what I expect. When I export that
same text to a buffer though, the line breaks are included. Currently I use
=sacha/unfill-paragraph= on that code.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-export-preserve-breaks nil)
#+END_SRC

When exporting anything, do not insert the exported content into the kill ring.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-export-copy-to-kill-ring nil)
#+END_SRC

By default I never want a table of contents generated. It is so easy to enable
it with a property, it will be fine to turn it off.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-export-with-toc nil)
#+END_SRC

On export, maintain the literal spacing as found in the source block. Obviously
this is important for make-files. It is really important everywhere because
anything else would violate the law of least surprise.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-src-preserve-indentation t)
#+END_SRC

*** Exports

Always share source blocks and their results. Whether or not to generate a
result for a particular source block is configured per-block. If you don't want
to share a result for a source block then disable storage of results on that
block.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(help/set-org-babel-default-header-args :exports "both")
#+END_SRC


*** KOMA-Script

I enjoy writing letters. I enjoy reading letters. LaTeX produces letters that
are easy to print and read. Org provides a [[http://orgmode.org/worg/exporters/koma-letter-export.html][KOMA Script exporter]] for [[https://www.ctan.org/pkg/koma-script?lang%3Den][KOMA-script]].
The Org documentation mentions that the user should read the [[http://orgmode.org/cgit.cgi/org-mode.git/plain/contrib/lisp/ox-koma-letter.el][ox-koma-letter.el]]
header documentation.

The [[https://www.ctan.org/pkg/babel?lang%3Den][babel]] packages is mentioned in the Org documentation. The package
documentation explains that it should be used with LaTeX, but not XeTeX. Some
time ago I decided to stick with LaTeX.

Load the KOMA exporter.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(eval-after-load 'ox '(require 'ox-koma-letter))
#+END_SRC

- Understanding KOMA and how to use it
  - There are 4 ways to set letter metadata, listed "from the most specific to
    the most general" (not sure exactly what this statement means, and the conclusion of my notes tries to make sense of what is really going on here and what is the best way to do things)
    - Org option lines (ORG)
    - Separate Org latex classes (LTX)
    - Emacs Lisp variables (LISP)
    - Letter Class Option files (LCO)
- Notes and thoughts on the ways to use it
  - LTX
    - By following the setup directions, you do this, creating "my-letter" class
    - Familiar and easy if you already know LaTeX
      - At some point in your workflow, you *must* define a class to use, anyway
    - Very easy to do, just define the class template and set =org-koma-letter-default-class=
  - ORG
    - Simple way that makes it very easy to just focus on the document content
    - This metadata takes highest priority in the workflow
      - So you should set your typical defaults in LISP or LCO and customize it
        here. This is exactly what I wanted to know.
      - This lets you do your tweaking in each unique file while relying on the
        most common defaults defined elsewhere
  - LISP
    - Very familiar style of configuring things
  - LCO
    - LCO == Letter Class Option files
    - LCO files are TeX
    - They are included in the generated TeX source code from the letter
    - Gives *full* access to KOMA-Script
      - Big deal, because not everything is exposed through ORG or LISP
      - Also gives full access to any and all TeX and LaTeX code
    - LCO files are a KOMA-Script thing, so they are a LaTeX thing
    -
      #+begin_quote
      Letter metadata set in LCO files overwrites letter metadata set in Emacs
      variables but not letter metadata set in the Org file.
      #+end_quote
    - When you include multiple LCO files, they are evaluated LIFO. Properties
      are set as they first appear, and are not set again. Say you include
      "MyGeneralStuffForAnyLetter.lco" and then include
      "MyStuffSpecificToThisLetter.lco". The specific stuff will get set first.
      Then general stuff will get set last.
      - Surely there is a better way to phrase this. I will work on that.
- Recommendations
  - What is the easiest way to start using KOMA-Script based on what you know
    today?
  - If you don't know any of the approaches
    - Then choose between learning LaTeX and Org
  - If you only know LaTeX
    - Then you will use the LTX/LCO metadata approach
  - If you only know ORG
    - Then you will use the ORG metadata approach
  - If you only know ORG and LISP
    - Then you will use the LISP approach for general metadata and the ORG
      approach specific metadata
  - If you know LTX/LCO, ORG, and LISP
    - Then you have total flexibility
    - The fact is that
      - ORG settings always trump LTX/LCO and LISP
      - LISP settings are a subset of all of the settings available in
        KOMA-Script, so you will always have to fall back to LTX/LCO if you want
        to use unexposed features
      - LCO files are just plain old LaTeX, which you already know
    - So the best thing to do
      - Is to use ORG for letter-specific settings
      - And LTX for general settings
      - Everything is a lot simpler this way because
        - One less metadata approach to keep track of
        - All KOMA-Script features are present
        - Need to learn details of KOMA-Script package anyway

Configure the default class.

[[https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/102922/how-can-i-get-us-letter-output-from-koma-scripts-scrlttr2-class][This]] post explains how to default the US letter size. That is the likely default

Never "automatically" evaluate a source block.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

Display emphasized text as you would in a WYSIWYG editor.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

Use Unicode characters to visualize things like right arrow eg \rarr . Most of those
symbols are correctly exported to the destination format. The most obvious is
this example in LaTeX versus Text.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-pretty-entities t)
#+END_SRC

Highlight LaTeX and related markup.

Normally, I don't do any syntax highlighting, as I believe that should be
delegated to source buffers, thinking that to do otherwise is distracting.
However, I already do configure subscripts and Greek letters to be displayed
with syntax highlighting, because I want to indicate to the human reader that
they are special, and specifically /not/-Unicode. Do the same thing for LaTeX
and related markup.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-highlight-latex-and-related '(latex script entities))

Though I am not delving deep, it is hard not to want to customize some stuff

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

It is /almost always/ faster to work with org documents when they are fully

/outline view/ again.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-startup-folded "nofold")
#+END_SRC

When images are displayed in the buffer, display them in their actual size. As
the operator, I want to know their true form. Any modifications required for
export will be stated explicitly.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

You may display syntax highlighting for code in source blocks. I don't.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

#+END_SRC

Never indent the contents of a source-block automatically.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-edit-src-content-indentation 0)
#+END_SRC

When edit mode is exited, the option exists to automatically remove empty
opening and closed lines for the source block. Never do this. The thing is that
I forgot why. When I was working on a recent analysis with ℝ there was a
space appearing in the opening and closing line of the source block that didn't
appear in the source editing buffer. That surprised me. I am sure that I've
forgotten why this is the case. I don't like it because you add a bunch of
empty lines in the source buffer for every source block. With that in mind I
will enable this feature and try it out again.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-src-strip-leading-and-trailing-blank-lines t)
#+END_SRC

The source block buffer may be configured to appear in a few different places.
For a while I really liked =reorganize-frame= because sometimes you want to be
able to see the code you are editing in edition to the rest of the document. At
least that is what I am telling myself. Once I learned you could change it I
realized that 1 I should have asked if it could be changed and 2 I should have
changed it. The flow that I've got configured here is that you are either in the
source document where code blocks are not highlighted or you are in the source
block so you are editing in a buffer that is full-fledged ALEC. That is the best
way so you can focus completely on each task at hand in the ideal mode for that
task. Anything else results in distractions and errors.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-src-window-setup 'current-window)
#+END_SRC

Org-Mode has a really nice feature that hitting =C-c C-c= will generally just do
the /right thing/. It is really nice. That feature extends to source blocks of
course. Ironically I had a typo here, typing /of curse/ instead of /of course/.
The thing is that you really, really need to develop a personal workflow, and
then configure the tool to enable it. The more I learn about Org-Mode, the more
leery I am about making it really easy to evaluate code. I want it to be a
really, really specific and decided action to evaluate a code block, so don't
make it so easy as =C-c C-c=.

** A Fine Cup of EMACS

Every EMACS user ought to have a [[http://shop.fsf.org/product/gnu-emacs-reference-mugs/][Emacs Reference Mug]] at their desk. The mug
invites other users to ask questions. Give the mug as a gift to every user you
know who would benefit from learning EMACS. The mug reminds us all that EMACS is
the perfect configuration of EMACS. It is available on every machine. When you
break your system, you can always fall back to the good and reliable default
EMACS configuration to get your system up and running again. The OOTB
configuration of EMACS is one of the most important system configurations that
you will every find. That is why it is important never to ruin it.

This system wants to maximize accessibility for new users. It wants anyone to be
able to download and use it without surprises. It wants the mug to serve as a
fine reference for anyone to use. It wants to keep things simple and familiar so
that anyone who has learned EMACS OOTB can use it pleasantly and productively.
These goals are essential to configuring the keyboard for this system. This
system will always respect the POLA.

** A Keyboard on Every Desk

The configuration of the keyboard on an EMACS system can completely change the
experience. No keyboard makes it impossible. A Kinesis Ergo makes it feel

[[http://xahlee.info/kbd/dvorak_and_all_keyboard_layouts.html][layout of letters]] is claimed to make you "more productive" using statistics.
You may even study the statistics of your own writing and choose a layout
optimized for you. The ways to configure your keyboard are limitless because
everyone is unique. How to get the best configuration tips for your system? Do
what works for everyone.

Choose a keyboard that will satisfy 80% of EMACS users using 80% of the
keyboards out there. Make this system easy to use on any one of those keyboards.
Make this system easy to use in English. Make this system easy to use with
average hand strength using two hands. These goals are essential to configuring
the keyboard for this system.

** A Full Pot of EMACS on Every Desk

*** Keyboard Layout & Operation

- Use QWERTY layout.
  - Everyone knows it.
  - Easy to learn.
  - Available on every keyboard.
  - Inexpensive.
  - When graduation time comes, plenty of great alternatives available like
    DVORAK and Colemak.
- Keep hands in home position as much as possible.
  - Every finger is strong in the home position so RSI reduced.
  - Single key presses are easy there.
- Table-bang the shift, caps-lock and enter keys.
  - Table-bang is a position of your hand. Make it by:
    - Starting with your hands in the home position.
    - Make a "high-five" with both of them parallel to the keyboard.
    - Turn your left hand counter-clockwise and right hand clockwise to make
      them perpendicular to the keyboard.
    - Squeeze all of your fingers together.
    - Push the keys using the side of your Pinky.
    - In this position you are using the strength of all of your fingers.
  - Never use those key using your Pinky alone.
  - Practice depends 100% on user-discipline.
- Try to achieve balance with meta keys.
  - Provide same key of each side of the keyboard.

*** Understanding Your Cognitive Landscape.

You operate within a cognitive landscape. Every moment you are in a single
=place=. While residing in each =place= you perform logically related =activities=.
Activities facilitate logical actions like modification within that =place=.
Modifications are performed objects. Objects include things like the contents of
a buffer, contents of memory, or the file that backs a buffer. While performing
those =activities= there is a logical sense of "flow". That should never be
interrupted. Usually an interruption occurs when you are going to go to a new
=place=. The =distance= between =places= is measured in the similarity between the
=actions= that you find there. As you develop these ides it will be obvious where
key-bindings should go

*** Key-Bindings Take You to Places to Perform Activities

OOTB you wil be visiting many =places= and performing many =activities=. EMACS comes
with a good configuration that minimizes =distance=. This isn't worth changing.
You can use EMACS for a lifetime without ever having to customize any of the
key-bindings. This is what lets anyone use your system. This is what lets you
use the system with =-Q= when you break it. You need to decide if you every want
to alter the default configuration. This system does not want to. It wants to
keep EMACS true to EMACS and your hands happy. To satisfy those goals the
following practices were defined.

- 99.999% of the time never bind to the =C= or =M= name-space.
  - They are for system key-bindings. You can break them. Don't.
  - In theory =C-c= is the "user name-space" but packages stomp on this all of the
    time anyway so don't use it.
  - Some bindings are just too valuable to pass up:
    - =C-;=
      - Your hands are in the home position already.
    - Every modifier key with return
- Never bind to =F= keys.
  - They are a painful stretch on most keyboards.
  - Some require a lone Pinky with is worse.
  - Most operating systems bind actions to them OOTB anyway.
  - EMACS comes with key-bindings OOTB.
- Don't try to set up a Hyper-key.
- Use shift as a name-space expansion vehicle.
  - Shift doubles every name-space in which you use it.

These practices say nothing about the =places= or =activities= that you choose to
peform. The practices only look at the key-binding configuration. There are a
limited number of keys on a keyboard and there are physical limitations on your
hands. Along with the previous assuptions it may look like there are less.
Fortunately it just looks that way and it isn't true. There are a lot of
powerful ways to "go places" with EMACS. The next heading contains my attempt.

*** How to Get There Pleasantly and Quickly

You need to learn how to use EMACS. You need to develop a personal preference.
You need to develop an idea of =places= and =activities= and =distance=. The following
headings are delineated by breaks in flow.

The examples try to talk about doing those things and do it by exploring:

- "going places to do things".
- "how quickly I will get there and how long I will be there"
- "how quickly I want to go somewhere else".

They were initially described by the properties:

- Actions :: The number of related actions in that place.
- Expertise :: The level of skill and speed with which you are performing the
  activity.
- Relationship :: How closely those activities are related in the current place.
- Frequency :: How many times you perform these actions when you here.

The relationship between "doing those things" and those 4 properties is still
unclear and being explored.

**** =s=
      :PROPERTIES:
      :Actions:          High
      :Expertise:        High
      :Relationship:     High
      :Frequency:        High
      :END:

- =Actions= here are for the =place= inside of the buffer itself. They are for
  immediate acting upon the contents of the buffer. They are logically
  related, used frequently, and likely to be memorized.
- When you come here, you are likely to stay for some time before getting
  out.
- Only use single key bindings; anything more may be a new logical
  name-space and may use a Hydra.
- Split the home sides of the keyboard in half.
- The left side of the keyboard should be use for operations common to
  every mode.
  - For example ~goto-line~ and ~ispell~.
  - It has 15 bindings available; 20 if you use 1-5. 40 if you shift them.
- The right side of the keyboard should be used operations specific to the
  current major mode.
  - For example in Org-Mode navigating between source-blocks and
    evaluating them.
  - It has 19 bindings available; 26 if you use 6-=. 52 if you shift them.

For example, in Org-Mode:

- I traverse the entire document very quickly with
  ~org-babel-previous-src-block~ and and ~org-babel-next-src-block.~
- I execute source-blocks.
- I edit source-blocks.

Every activity is related to reading, modifying, executing, and tangling code.

**** =Key-Chord=

Key-Chord is intriguing because it works on every keyboard. It is powerful
because it can you bring you to any =place= easily. It is good for taking you
places in two differnt kinds of scenarios.

One example is grammar-checking. There are a few ways to do that. I don't
remember them all. In a given mode I want to see a list of all the ways.
I really just want to see all of the stuff that I value for a given mode and
don't use frequently.

Another example are things that I value for a mode and use a lot but are not
logically related to other activities in that place. For example moving the
mark around and going to lines are performed a lot so they need to be done
quickly and left. This is a place where key-chords and the shift modifier are
a fast and intuitive way to go places.

***** Single-Key Key-Chord Name-Space.
      :Actions:          High
      :Expertise:        Low
      :Frequency:        High
      :Relationship:     Low

- Nice if you don't mind hitting the same key twice.
- You will use come here often, perform your single =action=, and be done
  and leave very frequently and quickly.
- Using alphabetical characters always results in unpleasant surprises.
- Harder for breakage but it still occurs.
  - =#FF= color code.
  - =cc= carbon copy.
  - JJ nick-name.
- Symbols are more likely to be safer bets.
  - Only use the symbols.
    - 8 if you use rows 3-4; 16 if you shift.
    - Fifth row has 13; 26 with shift.
- Good vehicle to reach a Hydra.

***** Two-Key Key-Chord Name-Space.
      :Actions:          Low
      :Expertise:        High
      :Frequency:        High
      :Relationship:     Low

- Very attractive.
- Nice if you don't like hitting the same key twice.
- Easy to use all fingers.
  - Finger strength is not an issue here; use any of them.
- Unexpected breakage very easy.
  - =cd= in ~=eshell=~.
- Use sparingly.
- Not worth analyzing ideal combinations; just use it and see if it
  doesn't break.
- Bringing over existing bindings. They are all for every mode so I will
  keep it that way.

**** =Hydra=
      :PROPERTIES:
      :Actions:          High
      :Expertise:        Low
      :Frequency:        Low
      :Relationship:     High
      :END:

- Sometimes you want to do something in a =place= but you aren't sure what
  and you aren't sure where you will go next from there. For example you
  might want to perform an Org-Mode =action= that is important but you don't
  really use much. For example exporting to HTML might not be common for
  you but you value.
- =Hydras= can be used for very related actions too. The difference between
  the =s= name-space is the distance between them and where you are now.
  In the =s= namespace you go there very quickly. For =Hydras= sometimes you
  can get the fast and sometimes more slowly. They are complementary to
  every name-space.

For example, in Org-Mode I am still learning about functions and haven't used
them much and forget their names. It is faster to put them in a Hydra. If they
get used a lot, I will add them to =s=.

*** Building Your Own Keyboard

As your mastery of EMACS grows so too will your desire to build your own
keyboard. It is natural. As you explore various dimensions of expression you
will have a lot of fun. You will act more quickly and skillfully. Even with the
goals of this system in place the desire grows.

3D printing is one area worth exploring. A lot of EMACS users design and print
their own custom keyboards. That looks very fun. [[http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id%3Dnrsi&id%3Dukelele][Ukulele]] is softer way to
explore your keyboard. Reading its user manual is important. It contains ideas
about stack-able-environments for bindings. You may use Ukulele or Hydras to do
the same thing. [[https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/][Karabiner]] is a nice way to re-map your keys. It's easiest
adjustment is to make return act as return when pressed alone and as control
when pressed with another key. That introduces a symmetry to your keyboard which
can be helpful. All of those dimensions are worth exploring.

When I explored them I felt that they led me further away from the majority of
users. Every time explored a different key-mapping (not key-binding) it reduced
accessibility for new users. Each time I tried to work around that hiccup. The
last pursuit was =;= and space.

It would be great to set up your keyboard with the meta keys on the bottom
like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
+---------------------------------------+
| +-----+                       +-----+ |
| |RET  |                       |  RET| |
| +-----+                       +-----+ |
| +------+                     +------+ |
| |SHIFT |                     | SHIFT| |
| +------+                     +------+ |
|        +-+ +-+ +-----+ +-+ +-+        |
|        |s| |M| |C/spc| |M| |s|        |
|        +-+ +-+ +-----+ +-+ +-+        |
|                                       |
+---------------------------------------+
#+END_EXAMPLE

Karabiner was too slow for my typing speed though. It [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/38qllb/karabiner_space_as_control/][happens]]. It seemed like a
minimal change to use Ukelele to:

- Make space send =C=
- Make =;= send space
- Make ='= a dead key
  - In it's dead key state make
    - =;= \rarr =;=
    - =:= \rarr =:=
    - ='= \rarr ='=
    - ="= \rarr ="=

The trouble is that it violates the POLA. Therefore, I left it alone and stuck
with a simple "Get C on both sides".

That has worked out very well. It is very easy to do on every operating system.
It holds true to the values of this system.

* Principle of Least Astonishment (POLA)
  :PROPERTIES:
  :noweb-ref: Principle-of-Least-Astonishment
  :END:

EMACS can load 3 different representations of a Emacs-Lisp source file code
OOTB. The name of source code file is the value before the file extension. When
you pass ~load~ a name it searches for an acceptable representation. Representation
types are indicated by their extension name. =.el= is a human readable and
uncompiled. =.elc= is not human readable and compiled. =.gz= is Gzip compressed and
contains =.el= or =.elc= files.

The variable ~load-suffixes~ determines the order for which text and byte-code
representations are first searched by extension-name. The variable
~load-file-rep-suffixes~ determines the order for all other extension types.

OOTB, EMACS combines the productivity of REPL style of development with the
speed of compiled code by ~load~'ing byte-code first, text second, and compressed
third. This workflow gives you the fastest code at run-time and lets you
experiment with new features stored in text. When you are ready to use them
every time, you compile them. There is only one downside of this approach: when
you forget that it works this way it can be confusing.

When you forget about that style of system you end up with surprising behavior.
The surprise comes when you forget to compile code and then write new code that
depends on the now old version of that code. After the next build, your system
can break in surprising ways. This violates the Principle of Least Astonishment.

This system values predictability so it does the simplest thing possible: ~load~
searches for the newest representation of a file and uses that one. It assumes
that Sysop has total and complete control over the management of file
representations.

This is the *first* thing that /ought/ to happen in the initialization of *any*
tangled system.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq load-prefer-newer t)
#+END_SRC

*Code requiring package-management can only follow this block.*

Before ELPA, I used SVN to manage software packages for EMACS. After ELPA,
I used ELPA-packages. Now this system uses MELPA and GNU. MELPA packages always
have their issues fixed very quickly. GNU packages rarely have issues.

Initialize Package.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package-initialize)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/") t)
#+END_SRC

Use-Package is the most configurable and performant way to manage ELPA packages.

Add the Use-Package distribution the load path.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/use-package")
#+END_SRC

Load Use-Package.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'use-package)
#+END_SRC
