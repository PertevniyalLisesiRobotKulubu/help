* Style Guide

- Code Block
  - Tell the story in speech, and then in code.
  - Consider it another paragraph and indent appropriately.
    - Never separate a paragraph and and a Code Block with a colon.
- Entity
  - Code Snippet
    - Use ~code style~.
  - Package
    - Same as Headline.
    - Dashes separate definition.
    - Acronyms are all upper case to distinguish from words for example "GNU"
      vs "Gnu".
- Headline
  - Capitalize nouns, verbs, and adjectives.
  - Don't capitalize conjunctions unless they are starting the definition.
  - Sell this chapter to the reader.
  - If it is a Noweb-Ref then its Entity name should be obvious. If it isn't
    then include a reminder in the heading.
- Hyperlink
  - External
    - Exclude those easily found with a search-engine unless you are willing to
      verify their existence frequently.
  - Internal
    - Heading artifacts can be referenced so the need here is minimal to
      non-existent.
- Plain List
  - End single sentences with a period.
